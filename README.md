Practice at writting golang tcp server using the old Maplestory MMORPG client (v28 ~ 2004) as it is well documented and contains a minimal amount of features that would enable me to say the server is complete

## TODO:
### World Server

- Need to send dropped login previous world id

### Login Server
- Accept pre-registered worlds

### Channel server
- Can get in game with static packet
- GM command for sending client packets
- Everything basically
